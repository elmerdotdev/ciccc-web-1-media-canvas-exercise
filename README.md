# Web 1 - Media and Canvas Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to help you better understand how some media elements work in browsers.

## Instructions

1. Create an audio element using the `piano.wav` file inside the `assets` folder. The audio should have audio controls, muted, and looping.

2. Create a video element using the `ocean.mp4` file. The video should have controls, muted, and a poster by default. Use the `poster.jpg` image provided.

3. Using the `fruit_table.jpg` image file, set the width to 600 pixels and create an image map. Create 3 clickable areas for the map:

    - One rectangle area for the lavender flowers
    - One rectangle area for the oranges
    - One circle area for the coffee

    Clicking on each area will redirect to their respective Wikipedia pages:

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavandula
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee

4. Create a canvas element with a width and height of 500 pixels and draw 4 lines to make a square. Each line should be a different color. Also, give your canvas a background color.

5. Finally, give your `body` tag a nice background image using the `background.jpg` file. Position the background image to the bottom center so that we see more of the grass and make sure it doesn't repeat. Add a green background color.
